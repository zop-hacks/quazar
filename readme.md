| **Sam**  | Structures your topic/details into a strict JSON schema.            |
| **Pam**  | (Optional) Summarizes any uploaded PDFs or docs.                    |
| **Roby** | Enriches Sam‚Äôs skeleton with background research and key concepts.  |
| **Nandy**| Generates the initial set of Q&A pairs (exactly as many as you request). |
| **Mal**  | Polishes each into a timed MCQ with three distractors.              |
| **Blip** | Reviews clarity & audience fit‚Äîflags errors for regeneration.      |
| **Nan**  | Fallback: replaces any flagged question with a fresh one.           |

## üéÆ Multiplayer Game Flow

1. **Host** generates a room code‚Äîplayers join via that code.  
2. **Host** starts the quiz; all clients receive the first question.  
3. **Players** answer; responses are time-stamped and scored by speed + correctness.  
4. After each question, a **leaderboard** updates in real time.  
5. At the end, the **top 3** players are highlighted.
