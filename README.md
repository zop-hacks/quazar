## üéÆ Multiplayer Game Flow

1. **Host** generates a room code‚Äîplayers join via that code.  
2. **Host** starts the quiz; all clients receive the first question.  
3. **Players** answer; responses are time-stamped and scored by speed + correctness.  
4. After each question, a **leaderboard** updates in real time.  
5. At the end, the **top 3** players are highlighted.
